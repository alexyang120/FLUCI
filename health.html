                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe research into which types of facial protection are the most reasonable for the average
                person in a low-risk area is inconclusive. However, the two main types are surgical and N95. Surgical should be worn
                with as little space open between the face and the edge of the mask as possible, as to try to keep fluids from entering
                the mask's inside. N95 masks are worn by medical professionals and are intensive protection from infection.
                Cloth based reusable, washable masks are unfortunately ineffective. Masks are generally best worn by ill patients. (Source: UCI SHC)

            <p class="bodyp">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn order to combat the spread of infectious diseases such as coronaviruses, aim to limit exposure to large
                groups of people while you are feeling ill. Stay indoors and rest until you recover and may then return to regularly attending
                large gatherings / classes. (Source: UCI SHC)
